              <p class="lead">Automated and adaptive python research project that implements multiple text classification methods, such as: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector. <br><br>The dataset consists of 200,000+ labeled records which contains a title, headline of the article, and a short description. With the input being the article's title and short description, our model would provide
                <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> the category to which the article belonged to e.g. "Business", "World News", "Sports"... ect. Over the course of three iterations of our model, we obtained an accuracy of ~75% success rate in categorizing. 
                <br><br><u>First Iteration </u><br>Implementation of Naive Bayes. Removed puncuation and stopwords such as "the", "at", "is". Accuracy at this time was 55% success rate. 
                <br><br> <u>Second Iteration </u><br> Implementation of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classification using Scikit-Learn library. Additionally, test unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams and found unigrams are definative.  
                <br><br> <u>Third Iteration </u><br> Implementation of Lematization and a new alpha value for Naive Bayes. We found that the article headline contains the highest degree of keywords so we doubled the value the words in the headline. With these changes, our final success rate is 75%. <br><br> <u>Important Links</u><br> Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset"> www.kaggle.com</a> <br> Articles used for research: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5477131">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5477131</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5277330">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5277330</a>

              <p class="lead">Full stack web/mobile application for users to track grocery inventory, share inventory, search recipes with items in inventory, use phone camera to scan receipts to add items in inventory, which is stored in an online database.
                With the user's interaction with the application as a design focual point, the application is easily navigable with minimal effort.</p>
              <p class ="lead"> The application acts as a "virtual refrigerator", where items can be added to the refrigerator via an image of a reciept or manually by user. These refrigerators and their items can be shared 
              <span id="dot">...</span><span id="add">with other users. Information about the items are displayed and can be organized by perishable date, calories, date added, or name. Possible recipes can be suggested based off items available. 
              <br><br> As a team, which consisted of Project Lead, Front-End, Back-End, Scrum and GitHub masters, we approached this project with agile software developement methodology. My role as Front-End lead entailed designing the applications interface centered on the user. The process of creating wireframes, mockups, high level storyboards and user stories provided opportunities for feedback in the design phase. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript was used for front-end Development.

              <p class="lead">User Interface and User Experience Front-End project designed for mobile devices. Users have the ability to track street parking regulations and restrictions, as well as, identify locations with available parking around San Franscisco State University.
                The goal of this project was to gain experience with the front-end developement process. 
                <span id="ellip">...</span><span id="show"><br><br>The project idea was aimed to solve a problem most students at SFSU have to endure. High-level use cases and personas, and story boards were used to create a prototype. This prototype was used in a real time focus group whose interaction with the application was analyzed for user experience testing.
                Feedback from the focus group was used to revise the applications design. One main challenge was to design the application with the user's need for simplistic and quick navigation due to its nature of a mobile app that will be used on the go.
